# NeuralNetworks
Writing a neural network from scratch \
\
Neural network.ipynb contains the development process of a neural network without using deep learning frameworks. \
The network class can be found in MyNeuralNet.py\
The handwritten digits dataset is used as a benchmark to verify that the network works as expected.
